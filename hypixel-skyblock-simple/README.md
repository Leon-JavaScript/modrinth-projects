### 🔧 Optional Features (Disabled by Default)

This modpack includes a small number of optional modules that remain **disabled by default**, but users may choose to enable them at their own discretion:

- **Freecam** – Sometimes viewed as an unfair advantage in certain contexts, though opinions vary. It is included for convenience but **remains off by default**.  
- **Fadeless** – Removes the Minecraft fade-in screen to allow instant gameplay. While generally harmless, it modifies client behavior and is therefore **opt-in only**.

Enabling any of these features is a **personal choice**, and users should ensure they comply with Hypixel’s rules and use them responsibly.
> **Whoever wants to use them can simply enable the toggle for these in the Modrinth app.**
